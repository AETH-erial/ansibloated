just keeping track of system configurations for my various   
desktops and servers i have. Ive been meaning to do this for sometime,  
but now that i have to use this shit at work itll make more sense to me.  
Its also a two fold thing, in that maybe ill understand my project at work   
better if i use this tool how its actually supposed to be used....
